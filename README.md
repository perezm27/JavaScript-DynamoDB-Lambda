## Lab: Lambda with API Gateway
Overview
In this lab, we will begin the task of migrating our application from a “monolithic” Java application into a truly cloud based application, with distributed functions, services, and events.

## Feature Tasks
* Migrate the functionality of your Create, Update, and Delete methods in your original Taskmaster Java application to their matching Lambda functions.
* You may use any language to create these functions!
* These endpoints should work ONLY with JSON data or URL Params
* Taskmaster functionality must remain the same
* With the exception of History (do not implement)
* Refactor your react application to send a JSON object to the server instead of raw form data
